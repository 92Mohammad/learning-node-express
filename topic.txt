Express =>  1) Express is  a fast,, unopinioted minimalist web framework for node.js
            2) Express is a server side or back-end framework. It is not comaparable to client side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue
            3) It can be used in combination to those frameworks to build a full stack application 

Middleware => Middleware are function that have access to request and response object
            Express have built in middleware but middleware also comes from third party packages
            as well as custom middleware.
        Process of middleware:-
            -> Execute any code 
            -> make changes to req and res object 
            -> end response cycle
            -> call next middleware in in the stack


difference between the (==) & (===) operator 
(==): operator does not check the type of both operand, It only compare the value and returns true or false value
example => let a = 100
           let b = '100'
           console.log(a == b) => true
(===): operator does check the type of the both operand as well as the value of both operand 
example => let a = 100
           let b = '100'
           console.log(a === b) => false
